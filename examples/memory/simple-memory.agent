# Simple Memory Example
#
# Demonstrates basic semantic memory operations:
# - memory_remember: Store insights
# - memory_recall: Retrieve relevant memories
# - memory_forget: Delete memories
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Enable memory in agent.toml:
#   [memory]
#   enabled = true
#   [memory.embedding]
#   provider = "openai"
#
# Run: agent run examples/memory/simple-memory.agent

WORKFLOW simple-memory

# First, remember some facts
GOAL remember-facts """
Store some important facts in memory for later recall.

1. Use memory_remember to store: "The project uses PostgreSQL 15 with JSONB for flexible schema"
2. Use memory_remember to store: "User prefers vim keybindings and dark mode"  
3. Use memory_remember to store: "API rate limit is 100 requests per minute"

Confirm each memory was stored successfully.
"""

# Now recall those facts
GOAL recall-facts """
Test recalling the stored memories.

1. Use memory_recall with query "database" - should find PostgreSQL info
2. Use memory_recall with query "user preferences" - should find vim/dark mode info
3. Use memory_recall with query "rate limits" - should find API limit info

Report what was found for each query.
"""

# Finally, demonstrate forgetting
GOAL forget-and-verify """
Demonstrate the forget capability.

1. Use memory_recall to find the API rate limit memory
2. Note the ID of that memory
3. Use memory_forget to delete it
4. Use memory_recall again to verify it's gone

Report the results.
