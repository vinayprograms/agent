# Network Penetration Testing Example
# Demonstrates security research mode for authorized network pentesting

SECURITY research "authorized penetration test of isolated lab network 192.168.100.0/24"

NAME network-pentest

INPUT target_network DEFAULT "192.168.100.0/24"
INPUT engagement_type DEFAULT "gray-box"

GOAL enumeration "Enumerate the target network $target_network:
- Discover live hosts
- Identify open ports and services
- Fingerprint operating systems
- Map network topology
Document all findings with IP addresses and service versions."

GOAL vulnerability_scan "Based on enumeration results, identify vulnerabilities:
- Check for known CVEs in discovered services
- Look for default credentials
- Identify misconfigurations
- Check for outdated software versions
Prioritize by exploitability and impact."

GOAL attack_paths "Develop potential attack paths:
- Initial access vectors
- Lateral movement opportunities  
- Privilege escalation paths
- Data exfiltration routes
Focus on realistic attack chains an adversary would use."

GOAL exploitation_plan "Create a detailed exploitation plan:
- Step-by-step procedures for each attack path
- Required tools and techniques
- Expected outcomes
- Risk assessment for each step
NOTE: This is for documentation - actual exploitation requires explicit approval."

GOAL defense_recommendations "Based on identified weaknesses, recommend defenses:
- Network segmentation improvements
- Access control changes
- Monitoring and detection rules
- Patch priorities
- Security architecture improvements"

GOAL executive_report "Generate an executive-level penetration test report:
- Business risk summary
- Key findings with risk ratings
- Attack path visualizations
- Prioritized remediation roadmap
- Compliance implications"
