# Vulnerability Assessment Example
# Demonstrates security research mode for web app testing

SECURITY research "vulnerability assessment of internal web application at app.internal.corp"

NAME vuln-assessment

INPUT target_url DEFAULT "https://app.internal.corp"
INPUT scope DEFAULT "OWASP Top 10"

GOAL recon "Perform reconnaissance on $target_url. Identify:
- Technology stack (frameworks, languages, servers)
- Entry points (forms, APIs, file uploads)
- Authentication mechanisms
- Session management approach
Document findings for vulnerability analysis."

GOAL vuln_analysis "Based on reconnaissance findings, analyze potential vulnerabilities:
- Check for common issues in identified frameworks
- Review authentication/session security
- Identify potential injection points
- Look for misconfigurations
Focus on $scope categories."

GOAL exploit_verification "For each identified vulnerability:
- Describe the attack vector
- Explain exploitation steps (theoretical)
- Assess impact and severity (CVSS if possible)
- Note any prerequisites for exploitation
DO NOT actually exploit - document for remediation."

GOAL remediation "Create remediation recommendations:
- Prioritized list of fixes
- Code examples where applicable
- Configuration changes needed
- Security headers and controls to add
- Testing steps to verify fixes"

GOAL report "Generate a professional vulnerability assessment report including:
- Executive summary
- Methodology
- Findings with severity ratings
- Detailed remediation steps
- Appendix with technical details"
