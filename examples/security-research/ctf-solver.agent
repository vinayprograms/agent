# CTF Challenge Solver Example
# Demonstrates security research mode for Capture The Flag competitions

SECURITY research "solving CTF challenges in authorized competition environment"

NAME ctf-solver

INPUT challenge_description
INPUT challenge_category DEFAULT "misc"
INPUT difficulty DEFAULT "medium"

GOAL understand "Analyze the CTF challenge:
- Parse the challenge description and hints
- Identify the category: $challenge_category
- Determine what skills/techniques are needed
- Research similar past challenges
- Form initial hypotheses about the solution approach"

GOAL reconnaissance "Gather information about the challenge:
- For web: analyze the application, find endpoints, check source
- For crypto: identify the algorithm, look for weaknesses
- For pwn: analyze the binary, find vulnerabilities
- For forensics: examine the artifact, extract data
- For reversing: analyze the binary, understand logic
Document all findings systematically."

GOAL exploit_development "Develop the exploit or solution:
- For web: craft payloads, chain vulnerabilities
- For crypto: implement the attack, break the cipher
- For pwn: write the exploit, achieve code execution
- For forensics: extract the hidden data, decode the flag
- For reversing: understand the algorithm, extract the key
Show your work step by step."

GOAL flag_extraction "Extract and verify the flag:
- Apply the developed exploit/solution
- Capture the flag in the expected format
- Verify the flag is correct
- Document the full solution path"

GOAL writeup "Create a CTF writeup:
- Challenge description and category
- Solution approach and methodology
- Step-by-step exploitation process
- Code/scripts used
- Lessons learned and techniques to remember
- Flag (redacted for sharing if needed)"

RUN solve USING understand, reconnaissance, exploit_development, flag_extraction, writeup
