  "success_criteria": {
    "primary": "Reader learns what microservices are, why they matter, and current best practices",
    "secondary": "Report is well-organized and cites specific technologies/patterns"
  },

  "content_requirements": {
    "must_cover": [
      "Definition of microservices vs monoliths",
      "Benefits: independent deployment, scaling, technology diversity",
      "Challenges: distributed systems complexity, data consistency, operational overhead",
      "Common patterns: API gateway, service mesh, event-driven communication",
      "Container orchestration (Kubernetes mentioned or implied)"
    ],
    "must_avoid": [
      "Outdated practices (e.g., SOAP as primary recommendation)",
      "Vague generalities without concrete examples",
      "One-sided advocacy without acknowledging tradeoffs"
    ]
  },

  "quality_rubric": {
    "accuracy": "Technical claims should be factually correct (e.g., service mesh does X, not Y)",
    "depth": "Goes beyond Wikipedia-level overview; includes practical considerations",
    "balance": "Presents both benefits and challenges honestly",
    "actionability": "Reader could use this to inform an architecture decision",
    "currency": "References modern practices (2020+), not legacy approaches"
